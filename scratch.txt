Let's say I really mess up a file. I'll use the same README.md that
I have been using.

In a preemptive manner, I know I've messed up the file and I can
redo my changes pretty easily. So, BEFORE I do a commit push, I 
just copy the file off somewhere and then delete it from my local
repository.

Step #1. copy the file off somewhere
Step #2. delete the file from your local repo
Step #3. check just that file out again
Step #4. add in only the changes you want
Step $5. git commit
